# VRMouse
##Running
The app itself runs as an intellij gradle based project. Under the ./raspberrypi_code/ directory there is a file containing the necessary code to run the server on a raspberry pi. Unfortunately, mine had some issues and I wasn't able to get the hardware done so I can't guaruntee it works.

There is also a /server/ directory which contains a script to run two webcams over rtsp protocol.
